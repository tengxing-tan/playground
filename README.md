# My Playground

**Done List**

- [Done list](https://tengxing-tan.github.io/playground/donelist-byindexeddb/) utilizes IndexedDB API to store user's data in local storage, including file/blobs. Which means it is an offline app.
- Users can enter task title, mark as done & remove it.
- Next step: the tasks saved to cloud if network is available.

**Others**

- [ ] Use Git Action to minify js when main branch is push. Write the workflow in `yaml`.
